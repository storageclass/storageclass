# What is Helm Chart?

A Helm Chart is a packaging standard used to define, install, and manage Kubernetes applications. Instead of manually applying dozens of YAML files, a Helm Chart lets you package related Kubernetes resources—like Deployments, Services, and PersistentVolumeClaims—into one deployable unit. It’s widely adopted because it streamlines operations across environments and enables consistent, repeatable deployments. The format and ecosystem are maintained by the [Helm open-source project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helm_(software)), part of the CNCF.

Helm supports versioning, rollback, and templating through a values file, making it easier to tailor deployments per environment. It also integrates well with CI/CD workflows and GitOps tools, reducing the overhead of managing complex applications manually.

## Why Helm Charts Are Widely Used

In production environments, Kubernetes applications often consist of multiple interdependent resources. Without Helm, managing these components across dev, staging, and prod environments becomes cumbersome. Helm Charts reduce duplication, enforce standardization, and eliminate the need to manually edit configurations for each deployment.

For teams managing infrastructure at scale, this consistency is crucial. Helm also enables easier rollback and tracking through its release system, which acts like version control for your Kubernetes resources.

## Key Benefits of Helm Charts

- Simplifies deployment of multi-resource Kubernetes apps  
- Supports templating and configuration overrides via values files  
- Enables version control and rollback for releases  
- Seamlessly fits into GitOps and CI/CD pipelines  
- Encourages reuse of infrastructure code across teams and environments  

## Helm Chart Structure

Each chart is a directory containing several required and optional files. `Chart.yaml` holds metadata like the chart name and version. `values.yaml` contains default configuration values, while the `templates/` directory includes Kubernetes manifest templates. Optional subcharts or dependencies can be managed through the `charts/` folder.

This structure supports modularity, making it easier to maintain and extend infrastructure over time. For instance, when deploying [stateful apps on Kubernetes](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/database-on-kubernetes/), you can standardize PostgreSQL, Redis, or MongoDB deployments using Helm Charts with custom configurations.

## Helm vs Raw YAML or Kustomize

Helm is often compared with tools like Kustomize or raw `kubectl apply`. While those tools work well for simpler use cases, Helm provides a more complete packaging and lifecycle management solution. It tracks releases, manages history, and supports parameterized configurations—making it a better fit for enterprise-grade infrastructure.

In environments where teams are deploying storage drivers, monitoring stacks, or multi-zone applications, Helm offers a layer of control and auditability that manual processes lack. This matters when you're managing [software-defined storage](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/software-defined-storage/) or building scalable pipelines.

## Simplyblock Helm Integration for Kubernetes Storage

Simplyblock™ provides a Helm Chart to deploy its NVMe-over-TCP CSI driver directly into Kubernetes clusters. This allows teams to provision block storage dynamically and consistently using StorageClasses tied to Simplyblock volumes. With support for fast volume creation and tenant isolation, it fits into environments that require high performance and scale.

When used alongside [Kubernetes cost optimization strategies](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/optimizing-kubernetes-costs/), the Helm-based deployment ensures reproducibility and speed, particularly in larger multi-tenant clusters.

## Real-World Usage and Best Practices

Teams often use Helm to deploy monitoring tools, CI/CD pipelines, and core infrastructure. It’s particularly useful in [multi-AZ environments](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/multi-availability-zone-disaster-recovery/) where infrastructure must be version-controlled and easily recoverable.

To get the most out of Helm:

- Use `values.yaml` files to separate configurations for dev, staging, and production
- Treat Helm Charts like code — store in version control, review, and test them
- Keep secrets and credentials out of charts; use integrations like sealed-secrets or external secret managers

Helm Charts also support OCI registries and private repositories, enabling secure distribution of internal infrastructure packages.

## Helm Charts in the Kubernetes Ecosystem

Helm is a mature tool with wide adoption and a robust ecosystem. Thousands of open-source charts are available for common tools and platforms. Documentation, best practices, and templates are well maintained on the [official Helm docs site](https://helm.sh/docs/).

For any team looking to automate and scale Kubernetes delivery, Helm Charts provide a consistent, flexible, and production-friendly path forward.
