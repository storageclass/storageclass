# What is NVMe over Fabrics?

NVMe over Fabrics (NVMe-oF) is a network protocol that extends the NVMe storage command set across high-speed network transports like Ethernet, Fibre Channel, or InfiniBand. It enables hosts to access remote NVMe storage devices with performance levels close to locally attached drives. By separating storage from compute, NVMe-oF supports fast, scalable architectures for cloud-native and enterprise environments.

In practice, [NVMe over Fabrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NVM_Express#NVMe_over_Fabrics) retains the low latency and queue-based architecture of local NVMe while moving data over a network. It solves the bottlenecks found in legacy storage protocols and gives developers a fast, consistent I/O path for modern distributed workloads.

## How NVMe-oF Works Across Networked Infrastructure

NVMe-oF uses the same command set as local NVMe but adds a transport abstraction layer to support network fabrics. These transports include RDMA (RoCE, InfiniBand), Fibre Channel, and increasingly, TCP. NVMe-over-TCP in particular has gained popularity for its ease of deployment over standard Ethernet.

The initiator (host) communicates with a remote target (storage subsystem) through command queues that closely mimic local disk behavior. This structure allows for massive parallelism with low CPU overhead.

The official [NVMe-oF specification](https://nvmexpress.org/developers/nvme-of-specification/) defines how fabric transports and NVMe subsystems interact and provides technical standards for enterprise implementation.

## Benefits of NVMe over Fabrics for Data-Intensive Applications

NVMe-oF delivers the performance of local NVMe storage with the flexibility of network-based infrastructure. Key benefits include:

- **Ultra-low latency** comparable to direct PCIe drives  
- **Parallel I/O** at massive scale across compute nodes  
- **Reduced CPU usage** compared to legacy storage stacks  
- **Scalable architecture** decoupled from physical storage locations  
- **Ideal for AI/ML, analytics, and time-sensitive services**

These characteristics make NVMe-oF a strong fit for high-throughput applications and multi-tenant systems where IOPS predictability is critical.

It also supports fast, persistent storage in [databases on Kubernetes](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/database-on-kubernetes/), where local disk access isn’t always feasible or resilient enough for production workloads.

## Where NVMe over Fabrics Outperforms Traditional Protocols

Conventional protocols like iSCSI and NFS introduce latency, bottlenecks, and extra CPU overhead — especially under concurrent workloads. NVMe-oF is purpose-built to solve those issues, offering faster access times and lower system load.

It’s already in use across [software-defined storage](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/software-defined-storage/), where performance and dynamic orchestration are critical. Unlike older approaches, NVMe-oF can scale out without compromising latency or IOPS, making it a better fit for modern cloud-native systems.

## How Simplyblock NVMe TCP Storage Works

Simplyblock supports NVMe-over-TCP as part of its cloud-native block storage engine. This lets you achieve the speed of NVMe without deploying complex RDMA networks or Fibre Channel fabrics.

It integrates directly with Kubernetes via CSI, supports dynamic provisioning and snapshots, and runs on standard Ethernet — making it a practical backend for containerized environments. Simplyblock brings NVMe-oF performance to everyday workloads in multi-tenant platforms, DevOps pipelines, and stateful apps.

## Deployment Scenarios That Benefit from NVMe-oF

Adopting NVMe-oF makes the most sense when workloads demand low-latency, high-throughput storage that can scale independently of compute. Typical scenarios include:

- Stateful services with high transaction volumes  
- Container-native databases or analytics tools  
- AI/ML model serving or inference platforms  
- Large-scale virtualized infrastructure

It also supports architectures like [multi-availability zone disaster recovery](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/multi-availability-zone-disaster-recovery/), where fast remote access to persistent storage improves failover speed and resilience.

## Is NVMe-oF Ready for General Adoption?

Initially adopted in performance-heavy data centers, NVMe-oF — especially the TCP transport — is now maturing into a viable option for broader use. Without the need for custom networking, NVMe/TCP offers a cost-effective path to modern storage.

More teams are adopting it as part of [cloud cost optimization strategies](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/cloud-cost-optimization-aws-storage-tiering/), replacing legacy SANs and tuning for high-efficiency, high-throughput I/O pipelines. With modern CSI support and growing Linux kernel integration, NVMe-oF is quickly becoming production-ready for a wide range of containerized and hybrid environments.
