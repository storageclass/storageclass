# What is ReadWriteOncePod in Kubernetes?

`ReadWriteOncePod` (RWO-Pod) is a specialized Kubernetes access mode introduced to enhance control over volume mounting in tightly scoped workloads. It refines the behavior of `ReadWriteOnce` (RWO) by limiting access to a single pod, rather than just a single node.

This change gives operators stronger guarantees about which pod owns a volume at any given time — a critical improvement for certain stateful workloads.

## What ReadWriteOncePod Changes in Volume Behavior

Traditionally, `ReadWriteOnce` volumes could be accessed by any pod on the same node, even if not explicitly tied to the intended consumer. With `ReadWriteOncePod`, Kubernetes enforces volume exclusivity at the pod level, blocking other pods from mounting the same volume — even if they run on the same node.

This behavior is defined under [Persistent Volume access modes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#access-modes), and it helps improve workload isolation and avoid accidental mounts during pod transitions.

## Why RWO-Pod Was Introduced

The `ReadWriteOncePod` mode solves a class of issues related to volume reuse. StatefulSets or pod restart loops can sometimes lead to unintentional remounts if the volume is still considered attached to the old pod. RWO-Pod ensures that only the originally bound pod — identified by its UID — can mount the volume.

By tightening this control, Kubernetes provides a higher level of safety for critical workloads where storage collisions must be avoided.

## Scheduling Implications with RWO-Pod

RWO-Pod introduces stricter scheduling behavior. If the bound pod is deleted, the volume must be cleanly detached before another pod can mount it — even if that pod shares the same name or spec.

This makes it especially important in scenarios involving [multi-zone failover](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/multi-availability-zone-disaster-recovery/) or [disaggregated storage deployments](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/disaggregated-storage/), where automation around volume lifecycle and readiness is essential.

## How ReadWriteOncePod Differs from ReadWriteOnce

The difference between these two modes lies in enforcement scope:

- `ReadWriteOnce`: Accessible by multiple pods on the same node  
- `ReadWriteOncePod`: Exclusively accessible by a single pod, cluster-wide

This added control helps prevent scenarios where shared access creates file corruption, particularly in environments with lower-level dependencies on [file system permissions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system_permissions).

## Compatibility and CSI Driver Support

Since Kubernetes v1.22, many CSI drivers have added support for RWO-Pod. However, compatibility must still be verified for each storage backend, especially with legacy drivers or non-standard volume plugins.

Organizations working with [KubeVirt workloads](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/kubevirt-storage/) or migrating virtual machines from [VMware into Kubernetes](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/vmware-migration-kubernetes/) should confirm driver behavior during pod restarts and failover.

## Simplyblock Support for ReadWriteOncePod

Simplyblock™ offers native support for `ReadWriteOncePod` via its NVMe-over-TCP CSI driver. Volumes can be dynamically provisioned with tight binding to individual pods, avoiding unintended cross-pod mounts.

This is useful in environments where isolation matters — such as [software-defined storage stacks](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/software-defined-storage/) or [CI pipelines using database branching](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/database-branching/) — where exact control over which pod owns a resource is critical.

## Best Practices for RWO-Pod in Production

To use RWO-Pod safely and reliably:

- Confirm CSI driver compatibility with `ReadWriteOncePod` mode  
- Monitor attach/detach operations across pod restarts  
- Use StorageClass parameters to tune provisioning behavior  
- Set up liveness probes that handle long detachment periods  
- Ensure no other pods attempt to reuse the volume by default

These precautions help maintain volume integrity while benefiting from Kubernetes' newest access control improvements.
