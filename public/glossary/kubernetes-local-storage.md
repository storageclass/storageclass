# What is Kubernetes Local Storage?

Kubernetes Local Storage is a node-specific storage option that allows pods to use block devices or directories directly attached to the node they're scheduled on. It delivers high throughput and low latency for workloads that don’t require cross-node volume mobility. For DevOps teams, platform engineers, and cloud-native architects, it's a powerful tool for unlocking fast persistent storage without network complexity.

## How Kubernetes Uses Direct-Attached Volumes

In Kubernetes, persistent storage is typically abstracted away through `PersistentVolume` (PV) and `PersistentVolumeClaim` (PVC) objects. With local storage, the PV points to a path or device that exists only on a specific node. The scheduler then uses `nodeAffinity` to ensure pods consuming that volume are assigned to the correct node.

This architecture eliminates the network layer entirely. Instead of relying on NFS, iSCSI, or cloud block storage, pods interact directly with fast local disks—often SSD or NVMe. This results in consistent latency and predictable performance, but with trade-offs in portability and high availability, as outlined in the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#local).

## Why Kubernetes Local Storage Matters

Applications are becoming more latency-sensitive, and infrastructure needs to match. Kubernetes Local Storage delivers:

- Low latency by skipping the network path  
- High throughput from direct disk access  
- Simple provisioning for caching, scratch space, and dev/test  
- Cost savings by reusing existing on-node devices  
- Compatibility with workloads that manage their own replication  

It’s an ideal fit when the data and the compute don't need to move independently.

## Using Local Storage with Software-Defined Platforms

Local volumes are often used alongside software-defined storage (SDS) platforms like [OpenEBS](https://www.simplyblock.io/glossary/what-is-openebs/) and [Rook](https://www.simplyblock.io/glossary/what-is-rook-storage/). These tools orchestrate local disks into shared, resilient storage systems with features like replication, dynamic provisioning, and pool-level abstraction.

This pairing enables infrastructure teams to achieve the performance of direct-attached storage while leveraging the automation and scalability of distributed systems. It's particularly useful for containerized workloads that expect fast, consistent IO without managing storage manually.

## Where Local Volumes Make an Impact

Kubernetes clusters running on bare metal infrastructure benefit significantly from local volumes, especially when using high-speed NVMe devices. By bypassing the network, pods gain direct access to underlying hardware for latency-critical tasks.

For databases such as PostgreSQL and MySQL, node-local storage enhances query performance and write throughput. Systems like ClickHouse and Redis, which often run in dedicated environments, also take advantage of predictable IO patterns. The benefits of this architecture are discussed further in the context of [PostgreSQL performance optimization](https://www.simplyblock.io/blog/best-open-source-tools-for-postgresql/).

In remote edge clusters, where bandwidth is constrained or shared storage is impractical, local volumes offer a straightforward path to resilient storage. For these environments, Kubernetes local storage is often combined with deployment models like [air-gapped edge clusters](https://www.simplyblock.io/supported-environments/edge-air-gapped-storage/), where operational simplicity and autonomy are critical.

CI pipelines, test automation, and short-lived sandbox clusters also leverage local volumes to minimize provisioning time and avoid network dependencies.

## How Simplyblock Supports This Model

[Simplyblock™](https://www.simplyblock.io/nvme-tcp-kubernetes-storage/) integrates Kubernetes-native provisioning of node-local NVMe volumes via its CSI driver. In environments where some workloads demand high-performance local IO and others require replicated, multi-node volumes, simplyblock enables both without adding operational overhead. Its integration with Kubernetes storage via NVMe/TCP allows teams to unify provisioning and management while retaining flexibility at the storage layer.

## Future-Proof Your Cluster Design

Kubernetes Local Storage gives you predictable, low-latency access to storage that’s already in your infrastructure. It requires no external hardware, simplifies provisioning, and delivers consistent performance for workloads that benefit from node affinity and direct disk access.

When used strategically—either alone or alongside SDS—local volumes are a key element in any efficient Kubernetes storage strategy.
