# What is Dynamic Provisioning in Kubernetes?

Dynamic provisioning in Kubernetes allows PersistentVolumes (PVs) to be created automatically when a user submits a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC). This removes the need for pre-allocated storage, allowing the system to respond to workload needs in real time.

The feature is driven by the use of StorageClasses, which define how the volume should be created — including backend drivers, performance parameters, and availability policies.

## How Dynamic Provisioning Works

When a PVC is created with a `StorageClassName`, the Kubernetes controller triggers the associated provisioner to create a compatible volume. The process uses the [Kubernetes StorageClass](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/) configuration to define which CSI driver is used and how the volume should be provisioned, including replication zone, disk type, and reclaim policy.

## Why Dynamic Provisioning Matters

In traditional environments, volumes had to be manually created and managed, which slowed down application deployments and introduced configuration risk. With dynamic provisioning, volumes are created automatically, minimizing delay and ensuring storage matches application needs.

This model fits well in cloud-native patterns such as CI/CD pipelines, ephemeral workloads, and stateful applications deployed at scale. It enables operators to rely on declarative infrastructure rather than manual intervention.

## StorageClasses and Controller Behavior

The controller-manager handles volume provisioning using StorageClass definitions. Each StorageClass includes values like the provisioner name (e.g., `ebs.csi.aws.com`), optional backend parameters, a reclaim policy (`Retain` or `Delete`), and binding mode.

This abstraction makes it possible to plug in different storage backends without modifying application-level PVCs. The approach draws from the design philosophy of modular volume systems like [Logical Volume Manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_Volume_Manager_(Linux)) in traditional Linux environments.

## Typical Use Cases

Dynamic provisioning supports a wide range of storage patterns:

In a multi-tenant Kubernetes environment, PVCs can be dynamically generated for each user without prior setup. In CI systems, test runs often need temporary databases or caches that can be spun up and torn down quickly. Workloads that span zones also benefit, as volumes can be created close to compute nodes depending on the binding policy.

The pattern is common in [database-as-a-service models](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/databases-as-a-service/), automated [EBS volume optimization](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/optimize-amazon-ebs-volumes-cost/), and [cloud-native disaster recovery](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/fast-backups-and-disaster-recovery/), where speed and automation are non-negotiable.

## Simplyblock Support for Dynamic Volumes

Simplyblock™ supports dynamic provisioning through its CSI driver, enabling real-time creation of NVMe-over-TCP volumes. StorageClasses can be defined to request volumes with specific performance tiers, replication factors, or backup options.

This model integrates well with [database workloads on Kubernetes](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/database-on-kubernetes/) and reduces the operational load for teams managing hundreds of dynamic PVCs across multiple zones.

## Operational Impact and Performance Gains

The effectiveness of dynamic provisioning depends on driver support and backend performance. Misconfigured StorageClasses, missing reclaim policies, or unsupported drivers can result in orphaned resources or failed mounts.

Teams operating multi-zone clusters must ensure that `WaitForFirstConsumer` is set for zonal-aware provisioning. This avoids placing volumes in zones with no pods, which can block scheduling.

## Best Practices for Using Dynamic Provisioning

To use dynamic provisioning safely in production:

- Choose CSI drivers that support your desired volume features  
- Use meaningful StorageClass names that reflect backend behavior  
- Set reclaim policies based on data retention needs  
- Monitor PVC creation, volume attach/detach latency, and error rates  
- Use volumeBindingMode to control when and where volumes are created

Done correctly, dynamic provisioning provides the flexibility and scale needed for modern Kubernetes operations without compromising control or reliability.
