# What is Kubernetes Block Storage?

Kubernetes Block Storage refers to persistent volumes that expose raw block devices to pods. These are ideal for high-performance, stateful workloads like transactional databases, analytics engines, or VM disks. Unlike file or object storage, block storage gives applications direct access to a virtual disk, where they can manage their own filesystems or write raw data.

In Kubernetes, block storage is typically provisioned through **Persistent Volumes (PVs)** using CSI drivers. Modern clusters use solutions such as Amazon EBS, Ceph RBD, or NVMe-over-TCP platforms. Block-level architecture, as used in [block storage systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_storage), enables low-latency, high-throughput access while maintaining data consistency.

## How Kubernetes Uses Block Storage

Kubernetes abstracts storage using PVs and PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs). When configured in block mode, a PV maps directly to a raw disk that a pod can format, mount, or write to. This approach is valuable for applications that require control over storage operations.

Block volumes can be statically or dynamically provisioned using **StorageClasses**. CSI drivers allow Kubernetes to integrate with external storage platforms, enabling dynamic provisioning, volume resizing, and snapshots without manual intervention.

These mechanisms are detailed in the [Kubernetes volume documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#block-volume-support), and they form the basis of how scalable stateful systems are deployed in production.

## Common Workloads That Rely on Block Storage

In most Kubernetes environments, raw block devices are preferred by applications where performance and consistency matter:

- Databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB  
- Distributed log platforms like Kafka  
- StatefulSets that need exclusive access to disk  
- VM images and disks in container-native virtualization  
- Fast local targets for incremental backup workflows  

Workloads like [KubeVirt-based virtualization](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/kubevirt-storage/) benefit significantly from block storage, especially when dealing with multi-tenant environments or resource-intensive operations.

## Why Block Storage Is Still the Default Choice

Block storage remains the preferred choice for applications that need reliable, low-latency disk I/O. Unlike network filesystems or object storage, block volumes behave like local disks and offer better control, performance, and isolation.

When deploying [Kubernetes-native databases](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/database-on-kubernetes/), raw block volumes allow for more predictable throughput and safer failover behavior. Developers can fine-tune database I/O performance without depending on shared filesystem semantics.

This makes block storage a default foundation for high-throughput, mission-critical applications in Kubernetes environments.

## Simplyblock and High-Performance Block Storage

Simplyblock™ delivers NVMe-over-TCP-based block storage for Kubernetes. Through its CSI integration, it supports dynamic provisioning, volume snapshots, and ultra-fast attach/detach operations. No special hardware or RDMA is required.

It’s a strong fit for teams looking to [optimize Amazon EBS costs](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/optimize-amazon-ebs-volumes-cost/) or reduce cloud spend while retaining high performance. Simplyblock provides a flexible way to align performance with workload tiering, all through Kubernetes-native interfaces.

## Challenges in Managing Block Storage in Kubernetes

Despite its benefits, block storage introduces some operational complexity:

Volumes are often restricted to a single node (ReadWriteOnce), which limits multi-node access. When a pod fails, the volume must detach cleanly before reattachment—adding latency or potential manual steps.

Backup, multi-zone support, and snapshot orchestration also require planning. CSI features like the snapshot controller help, but infrastructure design still plays a big role. For example, teams managing [fast backup and recovery](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/fast-backups-and-disaster-recovery/) strategies must consider volume lifecycle and zone affinity.

Security and access control also need to be enforced at the volume and namespace level using RBAC or StorageClasses.

## Getting the Most Out of Kubernetes Block Storage

To get the full benefit of Kubernetes block storage, start with dynamic provisioning via CSI drivers. Configure StorageClasses with proper IOPS caps, replication policies, and zone affinity based on workload needs. Align access modes with how your applications consume data—especially for databases, queues, or services that can’t tolerate contention.

Snapshot and backup policies should be baked into your deployment workflow, not added as an afterthought. Monitor volume performance and usage over time to ensure consistent throughput and stability. When done right, block storage offers speed, durability, and predictable cost—without sacrificing Kubernetes-native agility.
