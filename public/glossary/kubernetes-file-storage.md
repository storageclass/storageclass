# What is Kubernetes File Storage?

Kubernetes File Storage refers to persistent volumes that present a shared file system to pods, allowing multiple containers to access the same files concurrently. Unlike block storage, which exposes raw devices, file storage provides a mounted directory with hierarchical structure and POSIX compliance. Kubernetes supports file storage through PersistentVolumes (PVs) backed by NFS, CephFS, or managed services like Amazon EFS. It’s used when multiple pods need simultaneous read/write access to shared data.

## How Kubernetes Uses File Storage

Kubernetes handles file storage through PersistentVolumes and PersistentVolumeClaims. A PV represents the actual storage backend, while a PVC is a request from a workload. When a file-based volume is provisioned, it is mounted inside the container's filesystem, giving the application access to a shared directory.

Access modes like `ReadWriteMany` allow multiple pods to mount and write to the same volume. This makes file storage useful for workloads that need shared access. Kubernetes supports both static and dynamic provisioning via CSI drivers, as described in the [PersistentVolumes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/). Common file storage drivers include Amazon EFS, CephFS, and NFS provisioners.

## Common Workloads That Use File Storage

File storage is useful for workloads that rely on shared access or directory-based data structures, including:

- Content management systems like WordPress  
- CI/CD pipelines that write to shared workspaces  
- Media servers that serve static files  
- Log aggregation tools writing to shared volumes  
- Developer environments using shared home directories

These workloads benefit from standard file system semantics, file-level permissions, and the ability for multiple pods to write simultaneously.

## Why File Storage Remains Relevant in Kubernetes

File storage is still necessary for workloads that weren’t built with object or block storage in mind. Many legacy applications require file-based storage and can’t easily be reworked to use other models.

It’s also commonly used in dev/test environments, where flexibility and simplicity matter more than performance. In multi-zone deployments, distributed file systems like CephFS or managed offerings like EFS provide built-in availability and redundancy. In some cases, file storage is integrated into [multi-availability zone disaster recovery](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/multi-availability-zone-disaster-recovery/) strategies, especially when data must remain consistent across nodes.

## File Storage Options Commonly Used in Kubernetes

The most common file storage solutions are NFS, CephFS, Amazon EFS, and GlusterFS. NFS is easy to set up but lacks built-in HA unless externally configured. CephFS is distributed and integrates via CSI, offering scalability and multi-tenant access. Amazon EFS is managed and designed for EKS, with support for dynamic provisioning and multi-zone resilience. GlusterFS, while supported, has seen less adoption over time.

Choosing a backend depends on factors like operational complexity, latency sensitivity, and multi-tenant support. Some teams adopt [software-defined storage](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/software-defined-storage/) to simplify operations across multiple clusters. Ceph remains a common choice for file workloads at scale — background info is available in the [Ceph Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceph_(software)).

## Challenges in Managing File Storage in Kubernetes

File storage introduces performance bottlenecks under high concurrency. Network-based backends like NFS and EFS can struggle when many pods perform I/O operations at the same time. This leads to contention and latency issues, especially when used by workloads expecting high throughput.

Shared volumes also require extra care with file locking, permissions, and access control across tenants or namespaces. Rescheduling pods or recovering from node failure is slower with file storage because shared volumes can introduce tight coupling between workloads.

Snapshots and backups are not always straightforward, depending on the backend. CSI snapshot support helps, especially when integrated with [Kubernetes backup workflows](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/kubernetes-backup/), but not all file drivers implement this cleanly.

## Simplyblock as an Alternative to Traditional File Storage

While file storage meets basic shared-access needs, it doesn't perform well for high-throughput applications. Teams moving toward low-latency, scalable systems often replace file volumes with NVMe-backed block storage. [Simplyblock™](https://www.simplyblock.io/alternative-to-ceph/) provides NVMe-over-TCP storage with CSI support, delivering higher IOPS and lower latency than most file-based options. This is especially useful for performance-sensitive workloads or those that need dynamic provisioning, snapshots, and tenant isolation without the limitations of shared file systems.

## Getting the Most Out of Kubernetes File Storage

To use file storage effectively in Kubernetes, start by selecting a backend that supports `ReadWriteMany` access and CSI provisioning. Monitor performance carefully and avoid using shared file systems for workloads that require predictable latency. When applications start to hit limits, evaluate more scalable options like [disaggregated storage](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/disaggregated-storage/) or move to models designed for high-performance [Kubernetes databases](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/database-on-kubernetes/). Where compatibility is the goal, file storage still serves a purpose — but in modern, performance-focused setups, alternatives are increasingly taking the lead.
