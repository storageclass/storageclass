# What is ReadWriteMany in Kubernetes?

`ReadWriteMany` (RWX) is an access mode in Kubernetes that allows multiple pods across different nodes to read from and write to the same PersistentVolume simultaneously. It is essential for shared-storage workloads that require consistent access across the cluster, including distributed applications, content management systems, and parallel compute jobs.

## What ReadWriteMany Enables

Most traditional Kubernetes volumes are mounted using `ReadWriteOnce`, which restricts write access to a single node. By contrast, RWX allows pods scheduled on separate nodes to simultaneously write to the same volume.

This mode is ideal for workloads where shared state is necessary — for instance, when multiple services write to the same log directory or when web servers access a shared media repository. The [Kubernetes documentation on volume modes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#access-modes) outlines how this access model supports these patterns.

## RWX vs RWO: Architectural Trade-Offs

`ReadWriteMany` simplifies access for multi-node workloads, but it introduces complexity in the backend. RWX volumes typically rely on network-attached storage systems like NFS, CephFS, or GlusterFS. These systems must maintain consistency and locking mechanisms to handle concurrent writes.

Unlike RWO volumes that are directly attached as block devices, RWX backends are often file-system based. According to [Wikipedia’s write access article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_(system_call)), shared writes across processes or systems must be managed carefully to avoid collisions or data loss.

## When to Use RWX in Real Workloads

RWX is well-suited for scenarios requiring concurrent access to shared data. Stateless web services often serve shared content or configuration data across pods, while CI/CD systems rely on unified storage for logs and artifacts. Machine learning pipelines, especially in distributed training setups, also depend on shared data sources for model checkpoints and datasets. These workloads benefit from RWX volumes when paired with the right backend and I/O guarantees.

## Scheduling and Availability Considerations

Using RWX volumes doesn't eliminate scheduling constraints entirely. The CSI driver or NFS server must be available and performant enough to serve multiple I/O operations without bottlenecks. Some cloud-native file systems offer built-in redundancy, while others require manual HA configuration.

Teams operating across [hybrid multi-cloud environments](https://www.simplyblock.io/supported-environments/hybrid-multi-cloud-storage/) or [cloudstack-based infrastructure](https://www.simplyblock.io/supported-environments/cloudstack/) must validate storage behavior under load and during failover.

## Simplyblock Support for RWX-Compatible Workloads

Simplyblock™ supports high-performance file and block storage use cases through its CSI integration. While it focuses on NVMe-over-TCP for block workloads, many RWX scenarios can be adapted using layered file systems or shared data access patterns.

This is particularly effective in setups involving [databases as a service](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/databases-as-a-service/) or deployments that require [simplification of data management](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/simplification-of-data-management/), where shared control over volume data improves operational workflows.

## Avoiding Pitfalls in Shared Volume Architectures

To deploy RWX successfully:

- Choose a CSI driver or backend that supports native RWX semantics  
- Monitor for I/O saturation and contention  
- Use PVC-level quotas to limit overuse  
- Validate application behavior under concurrent writes  
- Secure shared volumes using Kubernetes RBAC and filesystem permissions

## Planning for RWX at Scale

As your cluster grows, shared volume patterns can introduce hidden bottlenecks. It's important to model I/O characteristics of RWX-bound applications and test performance under real conditions.

Distributed file systems must be sized for peak concurrency and backed with appropriate network throughput. RWX is a powerful tool — but only when implemented with awareness of its architectural demands.
