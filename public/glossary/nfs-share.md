# What is an NFS Share?

NFS Share refers to a directory or file system that is made accessible over a network using the Network File System (NFS) protocol. It enables multiple clients—such as servers, virtual machines, or containers—to read and write to the same file system remotely, as if it were mounted locally.

NFS was originally developed by Sun Microsystems and is still widely used for networked file access in Unix-like systems. As described in the [Wikipedia entry for NFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System), NFS uses a client-server model to allow data sharing across systems, often without the need for special hardware.

## How NFS Shares Work in Practice

NFS relies on a server-side daemon to export one or more file paths (shares) to other systems. Clients use a mount command to attach the shared directory to their local filesystem hierarchy.

Once mounted, the share behaves like any local folder. The protocol handles file I/O, permissions, locking, and metadata communication. Underneath, NFS uses TCP or UDP transport to transmit RPC (Remote Procedure Call) operations for file access.

The exported directory must be defined in `/etc/exports`, and access control is managed through export options, firewalls, and network-level restrictions. For deeper integration, many Linux distros support systemd-based automounting and version-aware mount helpers. Full configuration details are available in [man7.org’s NFS documentation](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/exports.5.html).

## Benefits of Using NFS for Shared Storage

NFS offers a familiar, OS-integrated way to share files across systems without the complexity of managing block-level devices. It supports file-level access, is easy to set up across Unix-like systems, and doesn't require specialized hardware. Features like permission mapping, basic file locking, and wide compatibility make it a practical option for teams needing shared access to data without introducing significant operational overhead.

For teams managing [cloud-native backup solutions](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/kubernetes-backup/), NFS can also be used as a low-cost target for backup snapshots or archival workloads.

## When NFS Fits Into Modern Architectures

NFS shares are still used in container-based environments, hybrid infrastructure, and Kubernetes clusters—especially where workloads need shared access to logs, model artifacts, or datasets.

They are commonly found in:

- Kubernetes deployments using ReadWriteMany volumes  
- Stateless apps that write session data or logs to a shared volume  
- [Proxmox environments](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/proxmox-storage/) for ISO images or VM templates  
- Content management systems that sync assets between web nodes  
- [Multi-AZ recovery plans](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/multi-availability-zone-disaster-recovery/) using NFS as a shared medium

However, while NFS works well for shared data, it’s not optimized for high-performance block-level access or concurrent heavy writes.

## Limitations and Considerations

NFS doesn’t scale as efficiently as distributed file systems or modern block storage systems. It introduces a single point of failure unless combined with HA strategies like NFS over DRBD or clustered filesystems.

Other things to watch for include authentication gaps in older versions (such as NFSv3), caching inconsistencies between clients, and limited performance under heavy concurrency. Teams deploying stateful services at scale often turn to block-based or distributed approaches to meet more demanding performance goals.

## How Simplyblock Supports Modern Shared Storage

Simplyblock™ focuses on scalable, high-throughput block storage, but it can also work alongside legacy NFS-based tools. By using NVMe-over-TCP with CSI support, Simplyblock gives platform teams fast, persistent volumes that outperform traditional file-level sharing models.

For example, [databases on Kubernetes](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/database-on-kubernetes/) and stateful microservices can run on block volumes, while backup processes or low-IO workloads continue using NFS for shared access when appropriate.

The result: a flexible, hybrid model where shared file access doesn’t limit performance or infrastructure scalability.

## Looking Ahead with Smarter Storage

Workloads are growing more dynamic, and expectations around performance and scale continue to rise. While NFS shares remain useful in many scenarios, it’s worth asking whether they meet the demands of today’s platforms.

Whether you're managing Kubernetes clusters, virtual machines, or hybrid apps, it may be time to balance traditional file shares with more modern storage strategies.

Teams that combine legacy compatibility with scalable block storage get the best of both worlds—without locking themselves into outdated infrastructure.
