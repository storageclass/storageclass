# What is GlusterFS?

GlusterFS is an open-source distributed file system that aggregates disk storage resources from multiple servers into a single global namespace. Built for horizontal scalability and high availability, it's used in environments that demand shared file access across nodes. While not native to Kubernetes, GlusterFS continues to support workloads that require ReadWriteMany (RWX) volumes, especially where POSIX compliance and on-prem control are essential.

## Connecting GlusterFS with Kubernetes Workloads

Kubernetes supports GlusterFS through CSI drivers that integrate with [Persistent Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#glusterfs), allowing pods to mount distributed file systems seamlessly.

To enable this, the GlusterFS client must be present on the nodes, and the backend storage cluster can be either external or containerized within Kubernetes itself using StatefulSets. While older clusters may rely on deprecated in-tree plugins, CSI drivers provide better integration with features like volume snapshots and dynamic provisioning.

This setup gives Kubernetes workloads access to a distributed POSIX-compliant file system without depending on external NFS or cloud-native file services.

## Workloads That Depend on Shared File Access

GlusterFS is a fit for workloads where several pods need simultaneous access to the same files. Examples include:

- CI pipelines writing build artifacts to a shared directory  
- Logging agents writing to centralized text logs  
- Media processing workflows reading/writing large files  
- Scientific computing jobs with shared data sets  
- Lightweight database clones for testing

These types of workloads benefit from GlusterFS's ability to expose a single, distributed POSIX-compatible file system across nodes.

## Why Some Clusters Still Choose GlusterFS

While cloud-native storage solutions have gained traction, GlusterFS still has use in situations where control, locality, or portability matter. It's file-based, scalable, and doesn’t rely on any proprietary cloud storage API.

Clusters deployed in regions with unreliable internet, those running under [CloudStack](https://www.simplyblock.io/supported-environments/cloudstack/), or on bare metal often use GlusterFS to provide consistent shared storage without depending on managed services. It also appeals to teams that prefer operating system-level tools over provider-native abstractions.

GlusterFS supports data replication, brick healing, and can self-manage its cluster state, making it well suited for constrained or compliance-heavy environments.

## Deployment Scenarios That Favor GlusterFS

GlusterFS typically shows up in self-managed or hybrid environments. For example, teams running [multi-availability zone disaster recovery](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/multi-availability-zone-disaster-recovery/) workflows may use it to replicate file data across physical locations.

It’s also relevant in air-gapped installations or edge infrastructure, where access to cloud-managed file systems like EFS or Filestore is unavailable. In these setups, Gluster bricks are often deployed using Kubernetes-native resources and configured for local fault tolerance.

The architecture is detailed further in the [Wikipedia entry on GlusterFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GlusterFS), which explains how volumes are distributed and replicated across bricks.

## Using Simplyblock with GlusterFS for Performance

Simplyblock™ offers a high-speed block storage layer that can underpin Gluster bricks. When Gluster volumes are deployed on top of NVMe-over-TCP devices provided by Simplyblock, the system benefits from faster I/O, reduced latency, and more predictable performance under heavy load.

This is particularly useful for teams using GlusterFS to serve time-sensitive applications. Running Gluster on top of [Proxmox-compatible storage](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/proxmox-storage/) or similar high-throughput backends eliminates some of the disk I/O limitations associated with conventional setups.

For organizations focused on [backup performance and disaster recovery](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/fast-backups-and-disaster-recovery/), this hybrid model helps reduce restore times while preserving RWX access to file-based data.

## Operating GlusterFS Effectively in Kubernetes

Running GlusterFS in Kubernetes comes with a learning curve, but it's manageable with proper planning. Gluster bricks should be placed on storage-optimized nodes, ideally separated using anti-affinity rules to avoid contention. Teams should monitor I/O usage patterns and rebalance volumes as needed to maintain performance.

Network isolation is another critical consideration—dedicated interfaces for GlusterFS traffic can reduce latency and help avoid congestion with other pod workloads. Operational efficiency also improves when Gluster volumes are integrated into CI/CD workflows and defined declaratively.

To minimize manual management, many teams adopt [data management tooling](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/simplification-of-data-management/) that handles provisioning, expansion, and error recovery. While GlusterFS requires more effort than managed cloud storage, it continues to serve specific needs in self-hosted, hybrid, and regulated environments.
