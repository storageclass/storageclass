# What is Kubernetes CSI?

The Kubernetes Container Storage Interface (CSI) is a standard API that enables Kubernetes to work with different storage systems—without needing to recompile or update the Kubernetes core. CSI decouples storage logic from the Kubernetes release cycle, allowing third-party vendors and in-house teams to build and maintain custom volume drivers. These CSI drivers are responsible for provisioning, attaching, mounting, resizing, and deleting volumes within a cluster.

The CSI specification was originally introduced by the [Container Storage Interface project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_Storage_Interface) to standardize volume integration across orchestrators like Kubernetes, Mesos, and Docker. Today, Kubernetes is the leading consumer of CSI, and CSI is the only supported method for extending Kubernetes with new volume plugins.

By abstracting storage provisioning and lifecycle management, CSI has become the backbone of dynamic storage in Kubernetes environments.

## How Kubernetes Uses CSI Drivers

In Kubernetes, CSI drivers are installed as DaemonSets or sidecars that run within the cluster and handle volume operations via gRPC. These drivers expose volume operations through the `csi.storage.k8s.io` interface, allowing Kubernetes components like the Kubelet, Controller Manager, and Scheduler to trigger lifecycle events.

Here's how it typically works:

- A `PersistentVolumeClaim` (PVC) is submitted by a workload.
- Kubernetes consults the StorageClass and invokes the CSI driver to create or bind a volume.
- The volume is attached to the target node and mounted into the pod’s filesystem.
- When the pod is deleted, the volume can either be retained, recycled, or deleted—depending on policy.

This architecture supports both block and file-based storage systems, with many popular backends such as Amazon EBS, Ceph, and OpenEBS offering [official CSI drivers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#csi).

The use of CSI provides advanced capabilities such as:

- On-demand volume provisioning  
- Inline ephemeral volumes  
- Volume resizing without disruption  
- Snapshot and restore operations  
- Topology-aware volume scheduling  

## Why CSI Matters for Stateful Kubernetes Workloads

Before CSI, Kubernetes relied on "in-tree" volume plugins, which were baked into the Kubernetes source code. This created delays and friction for storage vendors. CSI shifts this responsibility to external drivers, enabling:

- Faster updates and bug fixes  
- Broader support for storage backends  
- Clean separation between compute and storage concerns  

For platform teams running databases, data platforms, or SaaS applications, CSI makes it practical to use Kubernetes for stateful workloads. It provides the hooks required to keep data persistent across pod restarts, node failures, and application lifecycle changes.

In multi-availability zone or hybrid deployments, CSI can orchestrate storage provisioning and attachment intelligently, ensuring data durability while maintaining workload mobility.

## Where Kubernetes CSI Fits into Modern Storage Strategies

With the right CSI driver, Kubernetes can integrate seamlessly with:

- Cloud block storage (e.g., EBS, Azure Disk, GCP PD)  
- Distributed file systems (e.g., CephFS, GlusterFS)  
- Object storage gateways (via S3-compatible CSI drivers)  
- High-performance NVMe storage over standard Ethernet  

This flexibility enables a range of use cases—from [database performance optimization](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/database-performance-optimization/) to [fast backups and disaster recovery](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/fast-backups-and-disaster-recovery/).

Modern clusters are often heterogeneous, spanning cloud and on-prem environments. CSI drivers are central to managing persistent volumes in such setups, especially when integrating [Kubernetes storage](https://www.simplyblock.io/supported-environments/kubernetes-storage/) across different infrastructures.

## Simplyblock™ CSI simplifies high I/O Kubernetes storage

Simplyblock provides a CSI-compatible storage backend using NVMe-over-TCP, allowing Kubernetes clusters to provision and manage high-performance block volumes over standard Ethernet. This approach eliminates the need for RDMA or custom network infrastructure, offering near-local performance for stateful workloads.

With dynamic provisioning, snapshot support, and topology awareness, Simplyblock CSI makes it easy to run IOPS-sensitive applications like PostgreSQL or Cassandra inside Kubernetes—while retaining cloud-native agility and multitenancy. The system supports flexible storage policies that align with modern DevOps practices.

## Choosing the Right CSI Driver for Your Environment

Selecting a CSI driver should depend on your workload’s performance profile, storage topology, and data protection needs. Some environments prioritize cost, while others demand low-latency or multi-zone resilience.

Kubernetes CSI offers the modularity to support these decisions without locking you into a single vendor or architecture. And because CSI is now the default for persistent volumes in Kubernetes, investing in a robust driver implementation is key to any scalable infrastructure.
