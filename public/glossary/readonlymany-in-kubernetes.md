# What is ReadOnlyMany in Kubernetes?

`ReadOnlyMany` (ROX) is an access mode in Kubernetes that allows multiple pods, across one or more nodes, to mount the same volume with read-only access. This mode is useful when data must be shared widely without being modified, ensuring consistency and simplifying state management in large-scale workloads.

## What ReadOnlyMany Is Designed For

Unlike `ReadWriteOnce` (RWO) and `ReadWriteMany` (RWX), which allow write access, ROX guarantees that no pod can modify the volume's contents. This makes it an ideal fit for distributing static assets, prebuilt models, or configuration bundles across multiple pods running in parallel.

The [Kubernetes access modes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#access-modes) outlines ROX as a supported option in scenarios where immutable data needs to be consumed cluster-wide.

## Why ROX Simplifies Multi-Pod Deployments

ROX eliminates write contention entirely. Because no write operations are allowed, there is no need for distributed locking or write synchronization. This leads to simpler deployment logic and reduces the risk of corrupting shared data.

As noted in [Wikipedia’s article on read-only access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-only), enforcing immutability is a time-tested method for ensuring operational stability — especially in systems where many consumers access the same resource.

## Typical Use Cases for ROX

ReadOnlyMany volumes are often used in environments that require scalable and concurrent data reads. For instance, machine learning services might load the same pre-trained model, or multiple web applications might serve the same static content set.

This approach is also valuable in version-controlled data pipelines, where a fixed snapshot of input data is distributed to many jobs simultaneously, without any of them modifying it.

## Choosing Backends That Support ROX

Not all Kubernetes storage providers support ROX. It's generally enabled by file-based storage backends like NFS, CephFS, or GlusterFS. Cloud-native block storage systems, by contrast, usually don’t offer ROX behavior unless wrapped by a shared filesystem.

Teams running on [OpenStack-based environments](https://www.simplyblock.io/supported-environments/openstack/) or [Talos clusters](https://www.simplyblock.io/supported-environments/talos/) should verify that the underlying CSI driver can provision ROX-compatible volumes before adopting this pattern.

## Simplyblock Support for ReadOnly Access Patterns

Simplyblock™ primarily delivers NVMe-over-TCP block storage, but many ROX-style architectures can still be achieved by layering a shared or replicated filesystem over block volumes. This hybrid approach suits workloads in [air-gapped edge clusters](https://www.simplyblock.io/supported-environments/edge-air-gapped-storage/) or those running in [GKE environments](https://www.simplyblock.io/supported-environments/gke/), where high-speed access to consistent read-only data is critical.

When structured properly, this model supports scale-out performance without complex synchronization overhead.

## Key Practices for Using ReadOnlyMany Effectively

To make the most of ROX in production:

- Validate that your CSI driver and backend support ROX semantics  
- Keep the underlying data immutable once published  
- Test container behavior on read-only mounts — some apps assume write access  
- Use init containers if pre-processing or unpacking is required  
- Monitor read throughput and access latency under high concurrency

When applied to the right workloads, ROX volumes provide a simple and safe way to scale read access in Kubernetes without introducing write-related failures.
