# What is Kubernetes CSI Architecture?

The Kubernetes CSI (Container Storage Interface) architecture defines how Kubernetes interacts with external storage systems through a standardized interface. This design allows third-party storage vendors to develop CSI drivers that work with Kubernetes without needing to modify Kubernetes core.

Before CSI, all volume plugins were built directly into the Kubernetes codebase. That created upgrade delays, version conflicts, and maintenance overhead. CSI decouples the storage implementation from Kubernetes itself, improving modularity, versioning, and support for diverse storage systems—whether you're using cloud block storage, bare metal disks, or distributed file systems.

## How CSI Components Work Together

The CSI model introduces a few distinct services that operate outside the Kubernetes core but are critical to volume lifecycle operations. These components coordinate to handle everything from provisioning to mounting and resizing volumes.

Kubernetes relies on a set of CSI "sidecar" containers that act as intermediaries between Kubernetes and the actual CSI driver. These include the external provisioner for creating volumes, the attacher for managing volume attachments to nodes, and others like the resizer and snapshotter. On each worker node, the CSI node plugin performs actions like staging and mounting volumes. All these sidecars communicate using gRPC with the CSI driver, following strict API conventions.

In this model, Kubernetes doesn't care what kind of storage you're using—just that the CSI driver implements the required interfaces.

## Why CSI Architecture Scales Better Than In-Tree Plugins

In-tree plugins tied Kubernetes directly to specific storage platforms. Every update required upstream code changes, testing, and coordination across projects. CSI removes that friction.

With CSI, vendors maintain their own drivers, update on their own schedules, and roll out new features without waiting on Kubernetes releases. This decoupling also makes it easier to use Kubernetes in hybrid and multi-cloud environments where different workloads may need different storage backends.

For teams managing large-scale infrastructure or building [software-defined storage](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/software-defined-storage/) platforms, CSI provides the building blocks to maintain consistency across clouds, data centers, and edge environments.

## Core CSI Services at a Glance

Here’s a quick breakdown of the major components that make up CSI architecture:

- **External Provisioner** – Creates volumes in response to PVCs.
- **External Attacher** – Handles attaching and detaching volumes.
- **External Resizer** – Supports dynamic volume expansion.
- **External Snapshotter** – Enables volume snapshots and restores.
- **Node Plugin** – Mounts and unmounts volumes on individual nodes.

This modular structure keeps storage operations isolated, reliable, and easier to troubleshoot. Each component has its own logs, metrics, and failure boundaries.

## Simplyblock and CSI-Based Storage Design

Simplyblock™ implements a full CSI-compliant storage driver optimized for Kubernetes clusters. It includes all sidecar containers for provisioning, resizing, and snapshotting—while delivering high-speed block access using NVMe-over-TCP.

That means platform teams can use PersistentVolumes and StorageClasses just like with any other CSI-backed storage, but get better performance and tighter control. In production environments such as [Amazon EKS](https://www.simplyblock.io/supported-environments/amazon-eks/) or [on-prem Kubernetes clusters](https://www.simplyblock.io/supported-environments/kubernetes-storage/), Simplyblock can handle fast-growing workloads and stateful services without relying on legacy storage stacks.

Teams running [Kubernetes backup](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/kubernetes-backup/) strategies or [databases on Kubernetes](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/database-on-kubernetes/) benefit from the CSI architecture’s flexibility while retaining predictable IOPS and performance isolation.

## What to Check Before Running a CSI Driver

Not all CSI drivers are created equal. Some support only provisioning, while others also implement snapshot, clone, and resize features. Always confirm what your driver supports before deployment.

A good starting point is the [CSI spec documentation](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec), which outlines the gRPC APIs each driver must implement. You’ll also find requirements for controller-side and node-side capabilities. Additionally, Kubernetes defines its own CSI compatibility expectations in the [official storage documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#csi).

If your workloads require expansion, snapshotting, or zone-aware provisioning, make sure your StorageClasses and drivers are configured correctly.

## Why CSI Matters for Modern Storage

The CSI architecture is more than a technical detail—it’s the foundation of scalable, flexible storage in Kubernetes. It gives teams control over how volumes are provisioned, resized, and managed without having to dive into the internals of Kubernetes itself.

By using a well-supported CSI driver like Simplyblock, teams can build infrastructure that keeps up with dynamic storage demands, without sacrificing speed or operational clarity.
