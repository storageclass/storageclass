# What is Kubernetes Ephemeral Storage

Kubernetes Ephemeral Storage refers to temporary storage allocated to pods that lasts only as long as the pod exists. Unlike persistent volumes, this type of storage is deleted when the pod is terminated, making it suitable for stateless applications, caching, temporary processing, or scratch data.

Every Kubernetes node includes local disk space that can be used by containers through emptyDir, configMap, downwardAPI, or ephemeral volume sources. These storage types are lightweight and fast, since they don’t require provisioning or interaction with external storage systems.

Ephemeral storage is managed at the container level and enforced through resource limits. It’s an important piece of the Kubernetes storage model, allowing applications to operate quickly and efficiently without being tied to long-lived volumes. The use of [ephemeral storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubernetes#Storage) is growing alongside Kubernetes-native microservices that prioritize speed and elasticity.

## Why Kubernetes Uses Ephemeral Storage

In a Kubernetes environment, not all data needs to persist. Ephemeral storage is designed for use cases where speed matters more than durability. It supports several functions, such as temporary files written during container execution, scratch space for jobs or CI pipelines, in-memory caches, or transient logs that get shipped elsewhere.

These workloads benefit from local disk performance and avoid the complexity of setting up Persistent Volumes or CSI drivers.

## Common Patterns Where Ephemeral Storage Works Best

Here are typical use cases where ephemeral storage is not only acceptable — it’s ideal:

- Pods generating temporary build artifacts during CI/CD workflows  
- Caching data that can be regenerated or pulled from a source  
- Stateless web servers logging data to a local buffer  
- Machine learning tasks that load datasets into memory for one-time processing  

In cases like [database performance optimization](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/database-performance-optimization/), ephemeral volumes may be used alongside persistent volumes to manage temp files without overloading durable storage systems.

## How Ephemeral Storage Is Configured in Kubernetes

Ephemeral storage is managed via resource requests and limits in the pod spec. You can specify how much space a container is allowed to use, and Kubernetes will enforce eviction if it’s exceeded.
```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    ephemeral-storage: "1Gi"
  limits:
    ephemeral-storage: "2Gi"
   ```

If you want dynamic provisioning without long-term persistence, Kubernetes also supports inline ephemeral volumes via CSI. These are defined directly in the pod spec and are managed by CSI drivers, but behave like ephemeral local storage. This is documented in the Kubernetes [ephemeral volumes guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/ephemeral-volumes/).

## What to Watch Out For with Ephemeral Storage

While fast and convenient, ephemeral storage introduces risks if misused. Applications that accidentally rely on ephemeral data persisting will lose state after restarts. There’s also no backup, failover, or multi-zone protection. That’s why it’s critical to separate temporary data from durable data, monitor node-level disk usage closely, and apply proper limits in pod definitions. Use persistent volumes for critical data that must survive pod failures or restarts, and design your infrastructure so that ephemeral storage is clearly scoped and managed.

For production environments, teams often combine ephemeral storage with persistent options. For example, [Kubernetes backups](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/kubernetes-backup/) can focus on persistent volumes, while ephemeral space handles transient workloads.

## Simplyblock and Ephemeral Storage Use Cases

Simplyblock™ is built for persistent block storage, but its CSI integration can coexist with ephemeral storage strategies. Use Simplyblock for durable workloads that require high IOPS, then pair it with native ephemeral options for jobs, cache layers, or scratch data in your Kubernetes clusters.

This hybrid approach gives teams the flexibility to optimize both performance and cost — allocating premium resources only where durability is essential. Whether you're running [software-defined storage](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/software-defined-storage/) or deploying [cloud-native apps](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/database-on-kubernetes/), ephemeral storage remains a useful companion to your persistent layer.

## Choosing the Right Storage for the Job

Kubernetes makes it easy to mix and match storage types. Ephemeral storage is ideal for fast, disposable workloads that don’t need persistence. Persistent volumes, backed by a CSI solution, are critical when consistency and availability matter.

Architects and DevOps teams should design clusters that use both — with storage classes and policies to enforce best practices. Done right, ephemeral storage adds speed and simplicity, without risking stateful data.
