# What is ext4?

ext4 (Fourth Extended Filesystem) is a Linux journaling file system that balances reliability and performance for general-purpose workloads. It supports delayed allocation, extents, journaling, and large file systems, making it a stable choice for managing block devices. In Kubernetes, ext4 is frequently used as the file system layered on top of PersistentVolumes backed by block storage. Its wide compatibility, mature tooling, and low overhead make it the default in many CSI-based storage deployments.

## How Kubernetes Uses ext4

In Kubernetes, PersistentVolumes often rely on block storage backends such as Amazon EBS, Ceph RBD, or NVMe-based disks. These block devices must be formatted with a file system before they can store data. ext4 is typically applied at this layer. When a volume is dynamically provisioned using a CSI driver, the default formatting is often ext4 unless configured otherwise.

Kubernetes allows users to specify the `volumeMode` as `Filesystem`, which enables the volume to be formatted during provisioning. The `fsType` parameter in the StorageClass or CSI driver configuration defines the file system, and ext4 is the most commonly supported option. It integrates cleanly with container runtimes, supports POSIX operations, and introduces minimal system overhead. You can review the exact behavior in the [PersistentVolumes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/).

ext4 also handles unexpected shutdowns well through journaling, making it suitable for Kubernetes environments where node reboots, evictions, or pod restarts are common.

## Common Workloads That Use ext4

ext4 is widely used in Kubernetes to support volumes mounted by:

- Relational databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL  
- NoSQL systems such as MongoDB and Cassandra  
- StatefulSets running clustered applications  
- Persistent message queues like RabbitMQ  
- Virtual machines managed with [KubeVirt storage](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/kubevirt-storage/)

These workloads require predictable storage behavior and file system-level consistency. ext4 offers stable performance across a wide range of workloads, especially where tuning is minimal and operational simplicity is important.

## Why ext4 Remains Relevant in Kubernetes

Despite the growing adoption of more advanced file systems like XFS, Btrfs, or ZFS, ext4 remains the default in many production clusters. It is natively supported across all Linux distributions, well-understood by platform teams, and has decades of production stability behind it.

For workloads where the file system is not the bottleneck—such as small to mid-sized databases, logging, or queueing systems—ext4 performs well enough without the complexity of newer alternatives. In multi-cloud or hybrid environments, ext4’s consistent behavior across platforms is another reason why it's preferred.

Because Kubernetes workloads are often ephemeral or distributed, the simplicity and reliability of ext4 helps minimize storage-related issues. It also works well with [software-defined storage](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/software-defined-storage/) platforms that expose raw block devices, allowing ext4 to be applied consistently across environments.

## ext4 Options Commonly Used in Kubernetes

Most cloud storage backends and CSI drivers support ext4 as the default file system. Amazon EBS volumes, for example, are commonly formatted with ext4 when attached to pods via dynamic provisioning. Ceph-based drivers like RBD and newer NVMe-backed CSI plugins also support ext4 out of the box.

Some StorageClasses allow customization of the file system via the `parameters` field—letting users specify ext4 explicitly. It’s particularly relevant in clusters that use [disaggregated storage](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/disaggregated-storage/) to decouple compute and storage, where file system selection is managed independently of the underlying hardware.

More advanced workloads may override ext4 with file systems like XFS for tuning purposes, but for general-purpose use cases, ext4 remains the practical default. Additional details about ext4's capabilities are available in the [Wikipedia entry on ext4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ext4).

## Simplyblock for High-Performance ext4 Volumes

While ext4 is widely supported and stable, performance depends heavily on the underlying block storage. This is where Simplyblock™ fits in. It provides high-throughput NVMe-over-TCP block storage that integrates with Kubernetes through a CSI driver, allowing ext4-formatted volumes to be dynamically provisioned across clusters.

Simplyblock supports multi-tenant isolation, snapshots, and dynamic expansion while maintaining high IOPS and low latency. For teams using ext4 in performance-sensitive workloads—such as databases or Kubernetes-native VMs—Simplyblock enables reliable ext4 operation without the hardware limitations of traditional storage appliances. It's especially relevant in environments optimizing for [Kubernetes cost and performance](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/optimizing-kubernetes-costs/).

## Using ext4 Effectively in Kubernetes

ext4 performs best when paired with block storage that guarantees consistent throughput. CSI drivers that support dynamic provisioning and volume expansion can work seamlessly with ext4, especially when managing storage in high-scale, multi-cloud environments.

Teams should define appropriate mount options, set the correct `fsType` in their StorageClass, and validate that ext4 is suitable for their workload's I/O profile. In environments using high-speed backends or disaggregated infrastructure, ext4 remains a dependable, low-friction choice that simplifies storage operations.
