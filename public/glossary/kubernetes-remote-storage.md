# What is Kubernetes Remote Storage?

Kubernetes Remote Storage refers to persistent storage resources that are accessible over a network from outside the node running a given pod. It allows data to live independently of the compute infrastructure, enabling portability, replication, and centralized management. For infrastructure teams, DevOps engineers, and platform architects, remote storage is essential for scalable, fault-tolerant application design in Kubernetes clusters.

## How Kubernetes Uses Network-Attached Storage

Kubernetes abstracts storage through `PersistentVolume` (PV) and `PersistentVolumeClaim` (PVC) objects. When using remote storage, the PV is typically backed by a storage system external to the node—such as NFS, iSCSI, Ceph, or cloud block storage like Amazon EBS or Azure Disks.

Pods access this storage via the container runtime and kubelet, which mount the network-backed volumes into the pod’s filesystem. This design decouples storage from compute, making it possible to reschedule workloads across nodes without data loss. Kubernetes manages this through [Persistent Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) and supports automated integration with backends using dynamic provisioning.

Remote storage, such as [network-attached storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage), allows Kubernetes to decouple data from compute nodes, making it ideal for stateful workloads in dynamic clusters.

## Why Kubernetes Remote Storage Matters

Remote storage solves key limitations of node-local storage by enabling:

- Persistent data even if pods or nodes are deleted  
- Volume migration across nodes for rescheduled workloads  
- Integration with distributed file systems or object stores  
- Centralized data management and backup strategies  
- Multi-zone or multi-region fault tolerance (with the right backend)

These capabilities make remote storage essential for stateful applications that need high availability or are deployed in cloud-native environments.

## Using Remote Storage with SDS and CSI

Most Kubernetes clusters rely on CSI drivers to interface with remote storage platforms. These include cloud-native options like [Amazon EBS](https://www.simplyblock.io/glossary/what-is-amazon-ebs/), or distributed systems like [Ceph](https://www.simplyblock.io/glossary/what-is-ceph/), [Rook](https://www.simplyblock.io/glossary/what-is-rook-storage/), or [OpenEBS](https://www.simplyblock.io/glossary/what-is-openebs/).

These systems offer features such as:

- Dynamic provisioning of volumes  
- Volume expansion and snapshotting  
- Replication across failure domains  
- Storage class definitions with performance and redundancy profiles

Kubernetes handles storage orchestration through the control plane, while the underlying storage system takes care of data integrity, availability, and capacity.

## Stateful Workloads That Rely on Remote Storage

Running workloads in multi-node environments requires persistent storage that outlives individual pods or even machines. Kubernetes remote storage enables stateful sets and deployments to be rescheduled freely across the cluster without worrying about losing data.

For example, relational databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL benefit from having their volumes backed by remote block storage. This allows persistent data access regardless of pod restarts or node failures. A deeper look at [PostgreSQL storage requirements](https://www.simplyblock.io/blog/best-open-source-tools-for-postgresql/) reveals how consistency and recoverability depend on reliable, network-based volumes.

In cloud environments, remote storage supports dynamic provisioning of volumes, integration with managed backups, and separation of concerns between compute and data. Use cases include enterprise SaaS apps, legacy monoliths migrated into Kubernetes, and cloud-native services operating across availability zones.

At the same time, remote storage is foundational for multi-tenant environments and supports shared-access filesystems, object gateways, or deduplicated storage pools.

## How Simplyblock Supports Remote Volumes in Kubernetes

[Simplyblock™](https://www.simplyblock.io/nvme-tcp-kubernetes-storage/) provides high-performance remote block storage using NVMe-over-TCP, integrated via Kubernetes CSI. This enables pods to access persistent volumes with near-local latency over standard Ethernet networks, without requiring specialized hardware or RDMA.

The platform supports dynamic provisioning, volume snapshots, performance-tiering, and multi-tenant policies, making it a robust choice for teams building cloud-native or hybrid Kubernetes clusters that depend on consistent IOPS and scalable volume management.

## Designing for Portability and Persistence at Scale

Remote storage gives Kubernetes clusters the ability to scale without being limited by physical disks tied to specific nodes. It makes workloads portable, resilient, and easier to manage at scale. With CSI, SDS, and cloud-native integration, teams can build stateful systems that match the performance needs of production apps while staying flexible in where and how workloads are scheduled.

When paired with the right backend, Kubernetes Remote Storage becomes a key component of reliable, enterprise-ready container infrastructure.
