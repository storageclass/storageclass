# What is NVMe over TCP?

**NVMe over TCP** is a modern storage protocol that combines the speed of NVMe with the flexibility of standard IP networks. It enables fast, scalable, and low-latency access to block storage using existing Ethernet infrastructure. For DevOps teams, infrastructure engineers, and IT leaders, it's a game-changer in how enterprise data storage is deployed and scaled.

## Breaking It Down: NVMe + TCP

**NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express)** is a protocol designed for accessing high-speed storage like SSDs over PCIe. It significantly reduces latency and increases throughput compared to older protocols such as SATA or SAS.

**TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** is the backbone of modern networking. It's everywhere—from local data centers to public clouds. By layering NVMe on top of TCP, this protocol eliminates the need for specialized hardware like Fibre Channel or RDMA NICs.

## Why NVMe over TCP Matters

Today’s applications demand speed and flexibility. NVMe over TCP delivers:

- **Low latency** (as low as 150μs in optimal configurations)
- **High throughput** for IOPS-heavy and parallel workloads
- **Cost efficiency** with no need for proprietary networking gear
- **Flexible deployment** across bare metal, VMs, containers, and clouds

## SDS and NVMe over TCP: A Perfect Match

In [software-defined storage (SDS)](https://www.simplyblock.io/glossary/software-defined-storage-sds/) systems like simplyblock, NVMe over TCP performs exceptionally well. It allows total separation of hardware from software, providing teams with:

- Freedom to choose any hardware
- Linear scalability without rearchitecting
- Easy updates and continuous performance optimization

At simplyblock, we’ve designed our SDS platform to maximize NVMe over TCP:

- **Close-to-metal performance** on standard hardware
- **Hyper-converged and disaggregated architectures**
- **Automated benchmarking for optimal QoS**
- **Data path optimizations for TLC and QLC media**

## NVMe over TCP in Real World Scenarios

### Kubernetes Storage

Kubernetes needs persistent block storage that can keep up with fast compute. NVMe over TCP delivers the performance and flexibility containers demand.

### AI and Machine Learning

Training and inference workloads require high-speed I/O. NVMe over TCP ensures minimal storage bottlenecks during large-scale computation.

### Databases and Analytics

PostgreSQL, MySQL, or real-time analytics engines all benefit from low-latency, high-throughput storage. NVMe over TCP accelerates query performance and transactional throughput.
