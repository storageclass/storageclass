# What is ReadWriteOnce in Kubernetes?

`ReadWriteOnce` (RWO) is a Kubernetes access mode that allows a persistent volume to be mounted as read-write by a single node. This setup is commonly used to ensure data consistency and reliable storage for stateful applications running in containers.

## How ReadWriteOnce Works in Kubernetes

Kubernetes supports several access modes for PersistentVolumes (PVs): `ReadWriteOnce`, `ReadOnlyMany`, and `ReadWriteMany`. Among them, RWO is the most frequently used, especially with block storage systems like EBS or Azure Disk. According to the [Kubernetes documentation on access modes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#access-modes), RWO ensures that only one node can write to the volume at a time.

This restriction helps avoid simultaneous write conflicts, which can otherwise lead to data corruption in multi-node deployments.

## Why RWO Is Common in Production

RWO is the default access mode for most cloud storage providers and CSI-backed block devices. Because these volumes are typically zonal and directly attached to a single node, RWO aligns well with the architecture of services that demand dedicated I/O and write isolation.

In fact, [read–write access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93write_access) mechanisms in general computing often follow the same model for reliability — a single writer ensures integrity under failure conditions.

## Scheduling Behavior with RWO Volumes

When a pod uses a PVC that is bound to an RWO volume, Kubernetes restricts pod scheduling to the node where the volume is attached. If the node becomes unavailable, Kubernetes must first detach the volume before it can reschedule the pod to another node. This introduces a delay, but it protects against concurrent writes during transitions.

Operators managing [fast backups and disaster recovery](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/fast-backups-and-disaster-recovery/) often account for this delay using health probes and readiness checks to speed up failover procedures.

## Real-World Scenarios That Benefit from RWO

`ReadWriteOnce` is ideal for storage scenarios that benefit from exclusive access to ensure data integrity. It’s commonly used by transactional databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL, as well as file systems that maintain metadata or journaling structures. Applications that require consistent low-latency I/O, such as caching layers or log processors, also rely on RWO volumes. These workloads benefit from the performance and isolation that node-specific volume mounts offer.

## High Availability with RWO in Multi-Zone Clusters

While RWO restricts write access to a single node, some CSI drivers enable cross-zone volume reattachment. This feature is useful in clusters running [multi-availability zone disaster recovery](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/multi-availability-zone-disaster-recovery/) or other HA configurations.

However, failover time depends on how quickly the storage backend detaches and reattaches the volume. Teams running [performance-sensitive databases](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/database-performance-optimization/) should evaluate their CSI implementation for reattachment latency and volume fencing support.

## Simplyblock Support for ReadWriteOnce Volumes

Simplyblock™ provides NVMe-over-TCP storage that integrates with Kubernetes through a CSI driver supporting ReadWriteOnce mode. This allows dynamic attachment of volumes across zones, making it a suitable choice for [Proxmox storage](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/proxmox-storage/) or [low-latency block workloads](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/nvme-over-tcp-storage/).

With support for zonal failover, Simplyblock helps teams achieve consistent write behavior without sacrificing flexibility in cluster scheduling.

## Best Practices for Managing RWO Volumes

To operate RWO storage reliably at scale:

- Design failover-aware workloads that tolerate volume reattachment delays  
- Use health checks to trigger rescheduling quickly  
- Monitor volume events for attach/detach issues  
- Avoid multi-writer patterns unless your driver explicitly supports them  
- Implement snapshots or cloning for safe volume replication

RWO is simple to manage when paired with proper observability and scheduling rules — and it remains a foundational pattern for storage in Kubernetes.
