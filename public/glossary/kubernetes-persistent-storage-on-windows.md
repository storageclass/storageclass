# What is Kubernetes Persistent Storage on Windows?

Running stateful applications on Windows nodes in Kubernetes is no longer experimental. As enterprise adoption of Kubernetes on Windows grows, so does the need for persistent storage that works reliably across clusters with mixed operating systems. While Linux-based clusters have mature CSI implementations, Windows workloads introduce unique constraints around drivers, volume paths, and filesystem compatibility.

Kubernetes persistent storage on Windows focuses on enabling block and file volumes to be mounted into Windows-based pods with the same level of reliability and automation available to Linux users.

## Key Capabilities for Storage on Windows Nodes

PersistentVolume (PV) and PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) objects behave consistently across both Windows and Linux clusters. But because Windows nodes handle filesystem paths and mounting differently, only CSI drivers built specifically for Windows can provision volumes for those nodes. These drivers must support NTFS formatting, typically default to ReadWriteOnce access mode, and may not yet implement resizing or snapshotting on par with their Linux counterparts.

These [Windows-specific Kubernetes features](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/windows/intro-windows-in-kubernetes/) highlight differences in volume behavior, access modes, and CSI compatibility.

## Why Windows Workloads Still Need Persistent Storage

Despite being containerized, many Windows applications remain stateful. File-backed session storage, internal caching, database files, and configuration persistence are common requirements for applications written in .NET Framework or Windows-native tooling. These workloads often rely on stable paths, NTFS permissions, and specific directory structures, which makes persistent volumes critical for running them reliably in Kubernetes.

## How Persistent Storage Is Provisioned on Windows

To provide persistent volumes to Windows pods, Kubernetes requires a CSI driver that is built and deployed with Windows support. These drivers are typically installed as DaemonSets that run on each Windows node. When provisioning a volume, Kubernetes still uses StorageClass and PVC objects — but the actual implementation differs under the hood. Mount paths follow Windows conventions, and certain CSI operations may be unavailable depending on the cloud provider or local setup.

For example, [Azure Disk’s Windows support](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/azure-disks-dynamic-pv#supported-vm-skus-and-os-types) enables dynamic provisioning, but not all features like resizing or multi-node access are available.

## Use Cases That Benefit from CSI on Windows

- Replatforming traditional .NET apps without rewriting storage logic  
- Supporting CI/CD pipelines that run build agents inside Windows containers  
- Deploying Windows-based document management or asset storage systems  
- Building cross-platform applications where data must remain consistent  
- Moving legacy virtualized workloads into Kubernetes-native infrastructure  

Each of these gains stability when underlying volumes persist outside the pod lifecycle.

## Simplyblock and Windows-Compatible CSI Storage

Simplyblock™ delivers NVMe-over-TCP block storage with CSI support, making it suitable for both Linux and hybrid deployments. In environments running [Windows-compatible virtualized storage](https://www.simplyblock.io/supported-environments/vmware-storage/) or [hybrid multi-cloud storage](https://www.simplyblock.io/supported-environments/hybrid-multi-cloud-storage/), Simplyblock provides centralized volume control and high IOPS without depending on platform-specific disk types.

This makes it easier to manage persistent data across OS boundaries, especially when stateful apps run in mixed-container environments.

## Practical Considerations for Windows Storage

There are known limitations when running storage workloads on Windows in Kubernetes. CSI plugins may not support all features. Volumes are generally ReadWriteOnce, and NTFS-only. Init containers cannot be Linux-based, so pre-mount formatting or encryption tasks must be handled differently. Workarounds include scheduling logic, node affinity, and distinct StorageClasses aligned with the OS.

In Windows-first clusters hosting [databases as a service](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/databases-as-a-service/) or stateful microservices with [strict recovery objectives](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/reduction-of-rpo-rto/), volume reliability becomes a design priority.

## What Makes Kubernetes on Windows Storage-Ready

With CSI adoption expanding and vendor support improving, persistent storage on Windows is increasingly production-ready. Most modern drivers support dynamic provisioning, consistent volume attachment, and event monitoring. Kubernetes now allows teams to run stateful Windows workloads without needing external orchestration or manual recovery.

This unlocks new possibilities for teams refactoring legacy apps, running mixed-node clusters, or moving from VM-centric models to Kubernetes-native deployments — all without sacrificing data durability or resilience.
