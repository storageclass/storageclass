# What is Kubernetes Object Storage?

Kubernetes Object Storage refers to using external or integrated object-based systems to store unstructured data—like logs, backups, container images, and media—within Kubernetes environments. Unlike block or file storage, object storage relies on a flat address space and APIs to retrieve data, rather than exposing a traditional file system. In Kubernetes, it’s often used through S3-compatible interfaces or integrated tools like MinIO and Velero. This [object storage model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_storage) offers scalability and resiliency at a lower cost, especially for distributed, cloud-native workloads.

Object storage is not mounted like block storage; instead, applications use HTTP-based APIs to interact with the storage backend. This architecture decouples storage from compute, which improves scalability and makes it easier to manage workloads across clusters or availability zones.

## Why Object Storage Works Well with Kubernetes

In a typical Kubernetes deployment, persistent data is handled using volumes backed by block storage or network file systems. But for non-transactional, long-term data, object storage offers a more scalable solution. Applications interact with object storage via APIs rather than relying on mounted filesystems, which simplifies stateless architecture patterns and keeps infrastructure lean.

For example, container images, data backups, telemetry logs, and static assets can be stored in object stores, while mission-critical databases continue using Persistent Volumes. This separation allows platform teams to optimize for both performance and cost.

## Key Benefits of Kubernetes Object Storage

- Decouples storage from compute, increasing portability  
- Designed for scalability and high availability  
- Easy integration with CI/CD tools and logging systems  
- S3-compatible APIs enable wide tooling support  
- Ideal for cost-efficient long-term storage  

## How Workloads Use Object Storage

Most Kubernetes workloads don't mount object storage directly. Instead, they connect to it using client libraries or native S3-compatible interfaces. Backup tools like Velero push volume snapshots to a cloud bucket, while CI/CD systems use object storage to store artifacts or logs.

For example, in backup-heavy workflows, Kubernetes can offload volume data to MinIO or Amazon S3 using tools that integrate with native APIs. This reduces cluster resource usage and improves recovery options.

Object storage also plays a crucial role in disaster recovery. In multi-zone setups, it allows you to centralize critical data off the cluster. Teams working on [Kubernetes backup](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/kubernetes-backup/) or [multi-AZ failover strategies](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/multi-availability-zone-disaster-recovery/) often rely on object storage for long-term, cross-region durability.

## When to Choose Object Storage Over Persistent Volumes

Object storage isn’t meant to replace Persistent Volumes (PVs) entirely. PVs are ideal for stateful apps that need high-speed I/O and filesystem-level operations. But when your data doesn't need to be mounted—such as exported logs, backup files, or machine learning model checkpoints—object storage is often the better fit.

In modern DevOps pipelines, storing build artifacts or telemetry in S3-compatible buckets simplifies workflows and removes unnecessary storage overhead inside the cluster.

For teams implementing [software-defined storage](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/software-defined-storage/) or running cloud-native workloads, choosing the right storage tier becomes part of the architectural playbook.

## Simplyblock's Role in a Hybrid Storage Setup

Simplyblock™ focuses on high-performance block storage, not object APIs. But that’s why it works well alongside Kubernetes object storage strategies. Use Simplyblock for PersistentVolumes that need fast, durable IOPS—like for [database deployments on Kubernetes](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/database-on-kubernetes/). Then offload backups, logs, and artifacts to object storage systems that are optimized for scale and retention.

This hybrid approach gives DevOps teams the flexibility to build infrastructure that's fast, efficient, and cost-aligned.

## Tooling and Interfaces That Support Object Storage

Kubernetes itself doesn’t provision object storage, but it integrates with many tools that do. Developers and platform engineers can use:

- S3 clients embedded in applications  
- Tools like Velero, Kanister, or Restic for data backup  
- Operators like MinIO or Rook to run object stores in-cluster  
- External services like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Wasabi  

The Kubernetes ecosystem supports object storage mostly at the application or operator level. For technical specifics, consult the [Kubernetes storage concepts](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/) for guidance on storage models and integration points.
