# What is a CSI Driver?

A CSI driver is the software implementation of the Container Storage Interface specification. It provides a standardized way for container orchestrators to interact with storage systems. Instead of building and maintaining separate volume plugins for every storage backend and platform, orchestrators rely on CSI drivers to perform tasks like volume provisioning, mounting, unmounting, and deletion. Each CSI driver talks directly to a storage backend—whether that's a local disk, a distributed file system, or a cloud block storage service—and translates orchestrator requests into backend-specific operations. This abstraction enables consistent storage behavior across platforms while allowing vendors and infrastructure teams to deliver storage features without modifying the container platform itself ([Container Storage Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_Storage_Interface)).

## Where CSI Drivers Are Used

While Kubernetes is the most widely adopted orchestrator using CSI, the CSI spec was designed to be platform-agnostic. Other systems like Apache Mesos, HashiCorp Nomad, and Cloud Foundry also support CSI or have partial implementations. In all cases, CSI drivers serve the same function: providing a pluggable mechanism to connect storage systems to containerized applications.

Because the CSI interface is standardized, storage vendors only need to build one driver to support multiple orchestrators. This has significantly improved the pace of integration and has enabled a more stable storage ecosystem across the container world.

## Key Responsibilities of a CSI Driver

Every CSI driver implements a standard set of operations defined in the CSI spec. At a minimum, this includes creating and deleting volumes, attaching and detaching those volumes from nodes, and mounting them inside running containers. More advanced drivers also support features like volume snapshots, resizing, and cloning. The scope of functionality depends on the underlying storage backend and how much of the spec the driver supports. Detailed technical requirements are outlined in the [official CSI specification](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec).

## What to Look for in a CSI Driver

Choosing the right CSI driver depends on your environment, workload needs, and operational model. Whether you're using Kubernetes or another orchestrator, you’ll want to evaluate drivers based on:

- **Compatibility** – Does it support your storage backend and container platform?  
- **Feature set** – Snapshots, cloning, volume expansion, topology-awareness  
- **Performance profile** – Latency, throughput, IOPS behavior under real workloads  
- **Operational reliability** – Logging, monitoring, failover, upgrade paths  
- **Maintenance** – Is it actively updated and tested with recent platform versions?

Drivers that are actively maintained and built by vendors with production experience are usually better choices for enterprise use.

## Example Use Cases for CSI Drivers

In containerized environments, CSI drivers are essential for stateful applications. For example, persistent volumes provisioned through a CSI driver allow databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL to maintain storage across restarts. Snapshot support can automate backup pipelines. Topology-aware scheduling enables safe deployment across availability zones or regions. In dev/test environments, CSI makes it easy to spin up disposable volumes on demand. Whether you’re focused on reliability, portability, or cost control, CSI drivers support most modern infrastructure strategies.

Use cases like [databases on Kubernetes](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/database-on-kubernetes/), [cloud cost optimization](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/cloud-cost-optimization-aws-storage-tiering/), [fast backup and recovery](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/fast-backups-and-disaster-recovery/), and hybrid multi-cloud storage all depend on consistent, reliable CSI driver behavior.

## How Simplyblock™ Supports CSI Driver Workflows

Simplyblock provides a CSI-compatible driver designed for NVMe-over-TCP storage. It enables high-throughput, low-latency block storage over standard Ethernet without requiring RDMA. The driver supports standard CSI features like dynamic provisioning, snapshots, volume expansion, and topology awareness.

This makes it suitable for environments that need strong performance guarantees without locking into proprietary cloud or hardware systems. Whether used with Kubernetes or other CSI-aware platforms, Simplyblock’s implementation ensures compatibility while maintaining high IOPS and reliability for production workloads.

## Matching a CSI Driver to Your Platform Strategy

The CSI interface standardizes storage across orchestrators, but the actual driver determines performance, reliability, and operational fit. Before adopting one, it’s important to understand your platform's needs—whether that's multi-zone failover, fast snapshots, or predictable latency.

If you're building in Kubernetes, look for CSI drivers tested against the latest versions and supported by storage vendors with robust documentation and support channels. In hybrid or edge deployments, consider how well the driver handles node constraints, offline recovery, and storage migration. This also applies when deploying CSI in [hybrid multi-cloud storage](https://www.simplyblock.io/supported-environments/hybrid-multi-cloud-storage/) environments, where consistent behavior across clouds is essential.

For production environments, a CSI driver isn’t just a plugin—it’s the core interface between your application data and your infrastructure.
