# What are Kubernetes Storage Options?

Kubernetes offers a flexible and extensible storage architecture to support both stateless and stateful workloads. From local disks to networked file systems and cloud-native object stores, Kubernetes storage options are designed to fit a range of performance, cost, and durability requirements.

## How Kubernetes Handles Storage Abstraction

Kubernetes decouples application storage from pods using Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs). A PV represents a piece of storage provisioned by an administrator or dynamically by a StorageClass. PVCs are how workloads request that storage.

This abstraction allows pods to move freely across nodes while retaining access to persistent data. It also supports different backend types and access modes, making Kubernetes adaptable across hybrid and multi-cloud environments. The core mechanisms for provisioning and attaching storage are covered in the [Kubernetes storage documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/).

## Types of Storage Kubernetes Supports

Kubernetes can connect to a wide range of storage systems, including block storage, network file systems, object storage, ephemeral volumes, and raw block devices. Each option has different performance characteristics and use cases, depending on the workload and deployment model.

## Workloads That Influence Storage Choices

The ideal storage option depends on how the workload consumes data. Environments focused on [cloud cost optimization](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/cloud-cost-optimization-aws-storage-tiering/) often tier their workloads across multiple storage types to balance cost and performance. For example:

- Stateful applications need durable and consistent storage  
- CI/CD pipelines may use fast ephemeral volumes  
- Logs and metrics often write to distributed file systems  
- Object stores work well for archiving or backups  
- Virtual machines using KubeVirt may require raw block storage

## StorageClass Behavior and Flexibility

A key element in Kubernetes storage management is the StorageClass resource. It defines provisioner behavior, IOPS limits, encryption settings, and reclaim policies.

By creating multiple StorageClasses, teams can offer tiered performance for different service levels without manually managing underlying volumes. This is especially useful in clusters using [software-defined storage](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/software-defined-storage/), where infrastructure and orchestration are tightly integrated.

## Persistent Volumes vs Ephemeral Volumes

Not all workloads require persistence. Kubernetes supports both persistent and temporary volumes. Persistent Volumes retain data beyond the pod lifecycle, while ephemeral types like `emptyDir` or `ephemeral` clean up when a pod is deleted.

Selecting the right volume type is critical for maintaining application consistency. Operators should ensure that data-critical services never rely on ephemeral storage.

Clusters running mixed workloads — including stateless microservices and stateful databases — often separate these using namespaces and predefined storage policies.

## Simplyblock Support for Kubernetes Storage Options

Simplyblock™ provides Kubernetes-native block storage through its NVMe-over-TCP CSI driver. It supports both raw and filesystem-based volumes, enabling high-performance storage across cloud, on-prem, and edge deployments.

Because the driver integrates natively with Kubernetes, operators can use it within existing [Kubernetes storage environments](https://www.simplyblock.io/supported-environments/kubernetes-storage/), without complex provisioning logic. For use cases requiring scalable IOPS, Simplyblock’s [NVMe-over-TCP](https://www.simplyblock.io/use-cases/nvme-over-tcp-storage/) backend offers low-latency performance without specialized hardware.

## How to Select the Right Kubernetes Storage Option

Choosing the right Kubernetes storage option means aligning backend capabilities with workload behavior. Teams must consider factors like latency, availability, provisioning speed, and failure recovery.

Most production-grade clusters include a mix of block, file, and object storage to support diverse use cases. Storage should be evaluated not just on cost, but on access patterns and operational overhead.

For context on how Kubernetes evolved into a system supporting these modular components, the [Wikipedia page on Kubernetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubernetes) outlines its architecture and history.
